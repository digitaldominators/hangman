    <!-- How to Play Section -->
    <div class="how-to-play">
      <h3>How to Play</h3>
      <p>- Press start game or join game to join a multiplayer game.</p>
      <p>
        - Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels).
        If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the
        answer where that letter appears will be revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        - You may be able to guess what the answer is by selecting the ‘Guess
        the Word’ button or fill in the remaining letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        - The catch is every time you guess a letter wrong, you loose a life and
        the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.
      </p>
      <p>- Solve the puzzle before the hangman dies.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Multiplayer Section -->
    <div class="multiplayer">
      <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
      <p>- Press start game or join game to join a multiplayer game.</p>
      <p>
        - Input a category & secret word or phrase that the other player will
        have to guess, then press Start Game.
      </p>
      <p>- A code is then generated, which you can send to the other player.</p>
      <p>
        - The other player will enter that code in on the Join page & also input
        a secret word or phrase for the category.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Game Stats Section -->
    <div class="game-stats">

      <p>
        - Logged in players have the option to opt in or out to display their scores on the leaderboard.
      </p>
      <p>

    <!-- Settings Page Section -->
    <div class="settings-page">
      <h3>Settings Page</h3>
      <p>Levels</p>
      <p>
        - Easy: You’ll have 18 chances to guess before the stickman or skeleton
        is hung.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Medium: You’ll have 10 chances to guess before the hangman is
        completed.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Hard: You’ll have 6 chances to guess before the hangman is completed.
      </p>
      <p>Timer</p>
      <p>
        - The timer, by default, is turned off.
      </p> 
      <p>
        - You can use the Timer to set a time limit on turns for guessing during multiplayer games.
      </p>p>
      <p>
        - For example, if I set the timer to 10 seconds, then each player gets 10 seconds to guess the word/phrase on their turn. 
      </p>
      <p>
        - If you do not make a guess or select a letter and the timer runs out, then the other player can guess again and the timer resets.
      </p>
      <p>- Don’t worry if you don’t guess within the set time - no points will be deducted!</p>

      <p>Characters</p>
      <p>
        - You can select either the original Stickman or Skeleton character to
        be hung.
